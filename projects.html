          Storage Monitor
        </h3>
        <div class="space1"></div>
        During my internship at Two Sigma, I was tasked with building a platform for analyzing
        and monitoring internal storage systems. As a data-driven company, hundreds of petabytes
        of data are stored internally in various systems and data centers. To help keep track of
        the growing data storage (as well as things like misconfigured storage), I built a REST
        API that allowed you to query storage URIs and attributes like storage owners, total size,
        etc. This was backed by a "scraper" service that communicated with the various storage
        backends to collect the various metrics and settings for each storage location. The
        eventual goal for this platform is enabling better resource management by eliminating
        extra backups for unimportant data, cutting down on storage for abandoned data, and
        helping users optimize caching/pinning for their data to enable better performance.

        In my research, I've been working in the <a href="https://habanero.cc.gatech.edu/">Habanero
        Lab</a> at Georgia Tech under <a href="https://vsarkar.cc.gatech.edu/">Vivek Sarkar</a>
        and <a href="https://calebvoss.com/">Caleb Voss</a>. My project consists of a programming
        language designed to statically detect deadlocks. The language consists of a simple
        concurrent programming language built on top of Java and utilizes promises as it's core
        concurrency primitive. To aid in the static analysis, the language enforces that all
        promises are fulfilled in every code path by utilizing substructural typing (future work
        might visit static analysis for promise-dependency relationships to provide a complete
        deadlock detection system). A simple compiler (complete with a type checker, small runtime,
        and Java code generation) has been implemented in OCaml and I'm currently working to
        formally prove the language's semantics using the Coq proof assistant.

          Rust Operating System for Raspberry Pi
        </h3>
        When I took Operating Systems (CS3210), our semester long project involved building an
        operating system for the Raspberry Pi Model 3B+ in Rust. Our OS featured a "networked"
        bootloader over XModem+UART, support for the Pi's GPIO and timers, bin and bump memory
        allocators, a FAT32 filesystem, preemptive multitasking, a number of syscalls, and
        virtual memory. As our final project, my group focused on adding write support for the
        filesystem along with full-disk encryption. We also added support for mounting multiple
        filesystems, environment variables, file descriptors/locking files, command-line
        arguments and built a userspace shell using some POSIX-like syscalls.

        (Wow, too many class projects -- gotta find some time to work on some personal projects
        soon).

        <div class="space2"></div>
        As our final project for my Digital Design Lab (ECE2031), we were tasked with designing
        and implementing an SRAM interface for a simple computer on an Altera DE2 FPGA. Optimizing
        for performance, we chose to create a device with qword addressability, which enabled users to
        take advantage of spatial locality by performing multiple loads/stores simultaneously. We also
        clocked our interface asychronously from the CPU, which allowed us to communicate with the SRAM
        between CPU clock cycles. While not the most technically complex project on here, this project
        really helped me learn more about VHDL and FPGAs in general.

        In my compilers class (CS4240), we completed a toy compiler for the Tiger programming
        language. Using OCaml, our team developed a complete middle-end and backend for the
        MIPS-32 architecture. Heavily utilizing dataflow analyses, the compiler featured
        deadcode elimination, copy propogation, and Chaitin-Briggs register allocation. Best
        of all, I got the chance to finally use Nanocaml in a real project!

        For my Systems & Networks class (CS2200), we designed a number of datapaths for

        computer in a logic simulator called "CircuitSim", then built on top of it to add
        interrupts and support for external I/O devices. As an extra credit project, I
        created a 5-stage pipeline version of the computer, which supported data forwarding
        and flushing the pipeline in order to resolve various hazards.

          WebAssembly N-API port
        </h3>
        In 2019, I spent my summer at Google working with all the awesome folks on the
        Node.js team. As my internship project, I was tasked with rethinking how Node.js
        programs can compile with native libraries (compiled to WebAssembly). After
        prototyping a tool for generating glue code for bindings in C and JS, I decided on
        an approach based around the Node API (N-API). N-API's ubiquitous use for native
        libraries meant it was a great choice for porting existing libraries to WebAssembly
        and, more importantly, it was designed to be extremely portable. Taking advantage of
        this portability, I set out creating a port of the API to WebAssembly bindings. To
        do so, I created a fork of V8 that supported providing vendor "built-ins" to
        WebAssembly code. I then used C++ templates to generate type-safe wrappers for all
        N-API functions and finally modified the Node module loader to support these
        special WebAssembly "native modules."

        engine I wrote that utilizes fixed-point math. Drawing is done mainly using
        sprites (for the balls) and affine sprites (for the cue, i.e. sprites with a

        Quartz is a research project that aims to create a strongly-typed language for

        project, which aims to give Erlang static typing, Quartz attempts to apply
        multiparty session type theory to Erlang-style code. In order to do so, the
        compiler implements a novel type inference/type checking algorithm based on
        <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1304.1902">Pierre-Malo Deniélou's and Nobuko
        Yoshida's research into global session type synthesis.</a> The language itself
        is based loosely on Ruby and Elixir and compiles to Erlang code, but is designed
        around a new paradigm for actor programming using first-class session objects.

        Rolltrax started in late 2017 when my Work-Based Learning teacher, Brian

        my friend <a href="http://zachbayl.in/">Zach Baylin</a>. Together, the three
        of began implementing a website for managing off-campus students' attendance.
        This quickly evolved into a full-fledged app, complete with user-customizable
        dashboards to view metrics about student performance, a route manager for
        teachers travelling between job locations, and tools for employers to evaluate
        students' performance. The latest revision of the web app is written in Crystal

        Having been interested in compiler design for a while, I was intrigued when the

        compilers utilizes a large number of passes, each of which performs only a tiny
        transformation on the input program. After watching a talk and using the Racket
        nanopass library for a school project, I became inspired to design a similar
        system for OCaml. Using a PPX preprocessor, my friend
        <a href="https://github.com/iitalics">Milo Turner</a> and I whipped up a quick
        prototype of what such a library could look like. Though not yet battle-tested,
        this library provides a number of powerful abstractions for writing compilers
        quickly and easily.
