        Hi, I'm Ohad Rau.
        I'm currently a third-year student at Georgia Tech pursuing a B.S. in
        Computer Science with a concentration on systems/architecture and computer
        modeling. I'm also a co-founder/software engineer at
        <a href="https://rolltrax.com">Rolltrax</a>. In terms of CS, my interests
        are in programming languages, systems programming, and quantitative finance.

        <div class="space2"></div>

        When I'm not programming, you can find me listening to hip-hop (some favorite
        artists: MF DOOM, Isaiah Rashad, Kendrick Lamar, Freddie Gibbs) or playing PC
        games (i.e. Overwatch). Plus I really love <a href="/food.html">cooking!</a>

            <b>Built a high-throughput end-to-end load testing framework.</b> To gain confidence in mission-critical
            systems, it's important to know their performance charateristics and bottlenecks. Stress testing a system is
            a powerful way to measure its limitations and gain insight about its weakest links. During my internship, I
            was tasked with designing such a system for a new app. I later used this framework to find, document, and
            suggest improvements for several bottlenecks in the system. Before leaving, I also got to set this up as a
            regression test, so that we could be confident that performance would only improve with future changes.

            model for writing web apps: high performance, cross-platform, secure, and most of all an easy compilation target.
            Node.js apps frequently interface with native libraries, but support for portable native libraries is lacking.
            Using feedback from Node.js users, I experimented with several ways to compile native libraries to WebAssembly and
            package them for use with Node.js. My work began with a simple C-to-Node.js bindings generation tool and ultimately
            culminated in a proof-of-concept port of the Node.js API (NAPI) to WebAssembly.
