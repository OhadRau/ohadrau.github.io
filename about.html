        Hi, I'm Ohad Rau.
        I'm currently a fourth-year student at Georgia Tech pursuing a B.S. in
        Computer Science with a concentration on systems/architecture and computer
        modeling. I'm also a co-founder/software engineer at
        <a href="https://rolltrax.com">Rolltrax</a>. In terms of CS, my interests
        are in programming languages, systems programming, and quantitative finance.

        <div class="space2"></div>

        When I'm not programming, you can find me listening to hip-hop (some favorite
        artists: MF DOOM, Isaiah Rashad, Kendrick Lamar, Freddie Gibbs) or playing PC
        games (i.e. Overwatch). Plus I really love <a href="/food.html">cooking!</a>

              <b>Created a router configuration generator for multicast networks.</b> As with most trading firms, Jane Street makes
              <a href="https://signalsandthreads.com/multicast-and-the-markets/">extensive use of multicast networking</a>. Each
              time a new multicast network gets set up (e.g. building up a new data center) Network Engineers need to plan out the
              basic layout of the network, and then configure each router to know about the various groups, how to route messages,
              etc. This second step is a lot of work, and often requires duplicating similar information between different routers.
              And repeated work also means that there's potential to make mistakes each time the information is added to a new router.
              To improve this process, I spent the first half of my internship extending the internal networking library to parse,
              format, and generate these multicast configs. The final step of the project was setting up a tool that network engineers
              could use to translate their high-level description of a new data center into the individual configuration files for
              each router.

              <b>Added smarter caching to data-fetching framework.</b> The second half of my internship was spent on the Commodities
              trading desk, where my main project consisted of improving caching in a new framework called
              <a href="https://blog.janestreet.com/what-the-interns-have-wrought-2021/#memoization-in-datafetcher">Datafetcher</a>.
              Datafetcher is essentially a fancy dependency injection framework, in that it provides the usual dependency injection
              features (easy testing) but can also automatically batch fetches and cache their results. A few internal apps had
              already been converted to using Datafetcher, and while it showed some instant performance improvements, there were
              still some situations where caching wasn't good enough. In particular, sometimes apps would fetch the same data multiple
              times and then run some further computations on the fetched data. While the initial fetches were all cached correctly,
              programs still had to repeat all the subsequent work because the final results of computations weren't cached. Since the
              computations all used deferred evaluation, it wasn't possible to simply memoize the results with existing tools. I spent
              a few weeks coming up with an interface for memoizing these computations (with the goal of making it type-safe and
              easy-to-use), then converted an existing app to use Datafetcher and spent some time documenting best practices for the
              framework.

            systems, it's important to know their performance charateristics and bottlenecks. Stress testing a system is
            a powerful way to measure its limitations and gain insight about its weakest links. During my internship, I
            was tasked with designing such a system for a new app. I later used this framework to find, document, and
            suggest improvements for several bottlenecks in the system. Before leaving, I also got to set this up as a
            regression test, so that we could be confident that performance would only improve with future changes.

            Node.js apps frequently interface with native libraries, but support for portable native libraries is lacking.
            Using feedback from Node.js users, I experimented with several ways to compile native libraries to WebAssembly and
            package them for use with Node.js. My work began with a simple C-to-Node.js bindings generation tool and ultimately
            culminated in a proof-of-concept port of the Node.js API (NAPI) to WebAssembly.
