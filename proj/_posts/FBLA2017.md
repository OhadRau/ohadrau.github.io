# FBLA2017

This is my entry for FBLA's Coding & Programming event for 2017.

The project was developed in F# using WPF for the GUI and Sqlite for its database.

## Project Requirements:

Develop a database program to manage the general operations of a Family Entertainment Center (FEC). Give the FEC a name.
The program must allow the user to complete at minimum the following tasks:

* Enter/view/edit a list of employees
* Create/edit a weekly work schedule for employees
* Generate/print weekly schedule for employees
* Enter attendance of customers
* Enter/track, generate, and print report(s) showing customer attendance by time of day (AM/PM) and day of week
